## Understanding P&L Calculations

### Basic Formula

```
P&L = (Exit Price - Entry Price) Ã— Quantity
```

### Examples

- **Profitable Trade**: Bought 100 AAPL at $150, sold at $160
  - P&L = ($160 - $150) Ã— 100 = $1,000 profit
- **Loss Trade**: Bought 50 GOOGL at $2,500, sold at $2,400
  - P&L = ($2,400 - $2,500) Ã— 50 = -$5,000 loss

### Cumulative P&L

- Each trade's P&L is added to the running total
- Chart shows how your portfolio performance evolves over time
- Helps identify trends and trading patterns
